            <td valign="TOP" align="LEFT"><b>FAQ </b><br><span class="actxxsmall"> What are the size and weight restrictions of a pallet?<br>We offer a range of different pallet services to provide you the best possible rate for delivering your pallet. The standard pallet dimensions have a footprint/base size of 1.2m x 1.0m with a maximum height restriction of 2.2m and a maximum weight of 1,000kg, our prices start for a ¼ pallet size with a height of 0.80m and maximum weight of 250kg <br>We ask that you take care to measure your goods on the pallet as the collection depot will measure your pallet once collected to ensure it corresponds with the service you have booked and paid for. <br><br><br>What are your pallet packaging guidelines?<br>You must make sure goods are secured properly. If not the driver has every right to refuse to carry it. Packing an item correctly is vital to ensure its safety in transit between collection and delivery points. If the item is fragile it is advisable to wrap it in bubble wrap or cardboard to give it added protection. If the item being collected is of a mechanical nature itv is vital that all oils and lubricants are drained before the goods are placed on the pallet. This ensures the health and safety of everyone involved in the movement of the goods. Goods must not overhang the edges of the pallet.<br><br><br>Can PalletCourier provide a pallet for my goods?<br>Yes we can. Once you have entered all the necessary details an empty pallet can be requested by ticking the required box. A small charge is made for this service and we require at least one days working notice, therefore a premium collection service is not possible.<br>A pallet will be provided at the collection point and the sender will be have a 10 minutes time slot to pack and secure the goods safely on the pallet. It is not the driver’s responsibility to place the goods on the pallet. Please note that large and heavy items do need securing with either ratchet straps or another form of strapping to ensure they are safe and secure during transit. The most we can supply to secure goods is shrink wrap but this is only suitable for smaller and lighter items.<br><br><br>Loading facilities and vehicle access.<br>Unless you have a forklift truck at collection and delivery points you will need to select the ‘free tail lift’ option during the booking process. The driver will have a pallet pump truck to move the pallet onto the tail lift of the vehicle, it is essential therefore that the surface must be flat and constructed of either tarmac or concrete. We are unable to move goods using a pump truck on a gravel drive.<br>It is also important to take into consideration vehicle access. The smallest vehicle used in the palletways network is a 7.5 ton. If a household refuse collection vehicle can get to your property then there should not be a problem. If you are unsure, please contact us and we will check directly.<br><br><br>Are my goods insured during transit?<br>What is the insurance cover for any goods transported through your network?<br>All consignments handled through the Palletways system are subject to RHA Conditions of Carriage. The standard cover is £1,300 per tonne however if you'd like to increase this please contact us directly for an enhanced insurance quote. Enhanced insurance must be arranged at the time of booking and prior to collection for it to be valid. Palletcourier do not provide enhanced insurance on Aga’s, range cookers or similar.<br><br><br>Can you collect engines and gearboxes?<br>Yes we can collect these however, there are strict guide lines with items of this nature. These items have to be drained of all and other fluids, be pre palletised prior to collection or be ready to load onto the pallet the driver will bring if you have selected the provide pallet option They have to be securely strapped with either banding or ratchet straps and it is the customers responsibility to load and secure for transit, the customer must provide ratchet straps or similar to secure the item to the pallet, the driver will not have these on his vehicle and are not part of our service with providing a pallet.<br>If your item leaks onto other people’s pallets/goods you will be liable for the damage caused. This is vitally important!<br><br><br>Is the service and delivery dates guaranteed?<br>Unfortunately due to the nature of the business things can happen that are totally out of our control. Although 98% of deliveries are delivered on time, the odd 2% is late. We will, if aware, inform you of the late delivery and the reasons why. With European deliveries we endeavour to quote accurate delivery dates, however, the European vehicles coming to and from the UK can get held up due to the distance they have to travel and border controls etc. We unfortunately cannot be held responsible for the late delivery of pallets including Europe.<br><br><br>What if I miss the driver at the collection or delivery address?<br>The price paid is for one collection/delivery attempt only. Lorries are not cheap to run so if the pallet is not available the failed collection/delivery charge of £30.00 will still apply and the collection/delivery will not take place until this surcharge has been paid in full.<br><br>RESIDENTIAL ENGINE/GEARBOX - FAILED COLLECTION/DELIVERY<br>If your collection/delivery for an engine/gearbox on our residential engine/gearbox service fails due to customer fault - a charge of £30 is payable. Collections/Deliveries will be held until payment of this has been received.<br><br>Cancellations &amp; Refunds <br>Cancellations are subject to a administration fee of £15.00<br>Refunds are processed by original method of payment unless original method of payment is not available, in which case refund will be made via an alternative method of payment. Refunds will be processed by whatever means, within 30 days</span>
